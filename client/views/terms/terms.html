            </h2>

            <p>
                Mercher is a platform that allows users to offer, sell and buy products. As a platform, Mercher does not own or sell
                the items listed on this website; the actual contract for sale and all legal responsibilities for a vendor/vendee
                contract resides directly between the sellers and buyers.
            </p>

            <p>
                While we may provide pricing, shipping, and other guidance in our Services, such guidance is solely informational
                and is optional. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, Mercher has
                no control over and does not guarantee the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised; the truth or
                accuracy of users' content or listings; the ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to pay for
                items; or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item.

                do the right thing for both buyers and sellers.

                    You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a commitment to buy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You enter into a legally binding contract with the seller to purchase an item when you commit to buy an item.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You have paid attention to and understood the details of the transaction, as your total price may exclude taxes,
                    fees, and shipping costs, all of which you are responsible for funding.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For motor vehicles and real estate or (any transaction over $500 not including taxes and fees), an offer
                    initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's
                    item and does not create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mercher is not responsible for the transfer of legal ownership of items between parties.

                Returns
            </h3>

            <p>
                Sellers are required to specify your return policy in your listings, and clearly state if you do not accept returns.
                (If you are going to require that they put a return policy in the listing, you are going to have to have a box in
                the listing ideally when they do the listing, they specify their return policy….)Mercher encourages you to accept
                returns as it generates buyer satisfaction and repeat purchases.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you accept returns, a buyer can return an item for any reason, including a change of mind about purchases given
                the return meets seller’s stated time frame, condition, and any other requirements. Such return requirements should
                include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The time period in which a buyfaer must notify you about a return using a base date of date of purchase or date

            </h3>

            <p>
                Given Mercher is not involved in the contractual sale between buyer and seller, Mercher will not act as an
                arbitrator in any potential conflict resolution, unless requested by both parties. Any disputes should be resolved
                using the PayPal™ Resolution Process, as PayPal™ is the primary mechanism for sale consummation on
                Mercher. Mercher will make inquiries, provide relevant information, and may conduct an investigation into disputes,
                if alerted, but does not have capacity to be the final arbitrator of disputes. Repeat offenses from users will be
                noted and Mercher may take action to suspend their accounts. Otherwise, we recommend taking typical Internet
                commerce precautionary measures, including dealing locally and reviewing seller history.

                provided by Facebook® and PayPal™ services, following their respective terms of service.
